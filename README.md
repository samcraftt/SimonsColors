Simon's Colors is my first completed iOS app. The app mimics the classic Simon memory game in which 
players attempt to memorize and return the color pattern and as many times as they can, the pattern appending one element to its sequence each time.

Please [download the app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/simons-colors-memory-game/id6504947156) on the appstore; it's free!
