Simon's Colors is my first completed iOS app. The app mimics the classic Simon memory game in which 
players attempt to memorize and return a color pattern that gradually increases in length.

Please [download the app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/simons-colors-memory-game/id6504947156) on the appstore; it's free!
