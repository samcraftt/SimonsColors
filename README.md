Simon's Colors is my first completed iOS app. To streamline my pursuit of becoming an iOS app developer, I am learning Swift programming as I concurrently better my "prompt engineering" with LLMs such as GPT-4 and Claude 3.5.

Please [download the app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/simons-colors-memory-game/id6504947156) on the appstore; it's free!
